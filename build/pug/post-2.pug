          p.text-align-j As an established team with a rich business network, our support consists of end-to-end mentoring, feasibility studies,
            | MVP development, fund raising and marketing strategies, with the aim to provide concrete support
            | and expertise.

        +section-header({info: {title:"Business Study"}})._float-left._margin-b-md.text-align-j
          p.text-align-j We first validate the necessity of the product by
            | understanding the particularities of the market. To
            | this end, we set up user interviews and online
            | campaigns assessing customer
            | interests through direct feedback. In addition to
            | this, we test for data validity and accuracy to ensure 
            | fool-proof results.
        +section-header({info: {title:"MVP Development"}})._float-left._margin-b-md.text-align-j
          p.text-align-j Next we assist in developing the solution as an MVP
            | (Minimum Viable Product), which is a version of a
            | product with just enough features to satisfy early
            | customers and provide feedback for future product
            | re-development.
        
        +section-header({info: {title:"Go To Market"}})._float-left._margin-b-md.text-align-j
          p.text-align-j Once the MVP is developed, we work on the
            | marketing strategy, involving investors to
            | help launch the product smoothly. Funds
            | are used for operations, marketing and
            | redevelopment of the solution with
            | adaptations decided during the testing
            | phases. The overall objective is to develop its
            | features as well as reaching the profit point
            | required for the project to be viable. At this
            | stage, our support also extends to help your business expand globally.
