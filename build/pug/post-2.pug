          p.text-align-j An established team and a business network developed with stakeholders involved in each of the
            | project's stages. Our support consists of end-to-end mentoring, including the feasibility study,
            | MVP development, fund raising and marketing strategy, with the aim to provide concrete support
            | and high added value expertise.

        +section-header({info: {title:"Business Study"}})._float-left._margin-b-md.text-align-j
          p.text-align-j We first validate the necessity of the product by
            | understanding the particularities of the market. To
            | this end, we set up user interviews and online
            | communication campaigns assessing customer
            | interests and the nature of feedbacks, in addition to
            | all the technical tests necessary to approve the
            | validity of the solution.

        +section-header({info: {title:"MVP Development"}})._float-left._margin-b-md.text-align-j
          p.text-align-j Raise funds to develop the solution as an MVP
            | (Minimum Viable Product), which is a version of a
            | product with just enough features to satisfy early
            | customers and provide feedback for future product
            | Re-development
        
        +section-header({info: {title:"Go To Market"}})._float-left._margin-b-md.text-align-j
          p.text-align-j Once the MVP is developed, we work on the
            | marketing strategy, involving investors to
            | help launch the product smoothly. The fund
            | is used for operations, marketing and
            | redevelopment of the solution with
            | adaptations decided during the testing
            | phases. The overall objective is to develop its
            | features as well as reaching the profit point
            | required for the project to be viable. At this
            | stage, our support covers also the launch of
            | the solution in other foreign markets.
