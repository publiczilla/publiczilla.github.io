          p.text-align-j There is no longer any doubt, that we live in a world where all aspects of the economy
            | are being reinvented by major leaps and bounds. This in turn, is opening up a wide spectrum of new
            | opportunities for creators, driven by the ambition to innovate and disrupt. And such is the
            | starting point for each entrepreneurial journey, aiming to evolve in a context shaped
            | essentially by constant change and historical socio-economic challenges. And that is what 
            | makes our era unique.
        +section-header({info: {title:"Story of a Disruption"}})._float-left._margin-b-md.text-align-j
          p.text-align-j With each disruptive entrepreneurial path
            | come challenges that stand in the way of ambition,
            | challenges that can sometimes shake faith and
            | even lead to failure, regardless of its creative value
            | and potential to succeed in the market. This could be a
            | beginning of a journey of a thousand frustrations 
            | due to the failure of a prototype that may be
            | dragging on, or the inability to grasp the ins and outs
            | of the market, or even the difficulty to raise funds.
        +section-header({info: {title:"Disruption is the new obvious!"}})._float-left._margin-b-md.text-align-j
          p.text-align-j We usually tend to forget that disruption is hardly embraced. Instead,
            | resistance is the natural response to changes that challenge existing
            | metanarratives. Compare that to the comfort zone which we are so used to, 
            | and that becomes a difficult decision to take.
          p.text-align-j.top-paddx Most disruptive ideas are first perceived as ridiculous and bohemian
            | from a business perspective. It takes a lot of patience and resilience
            | before they reach the stage of serious perception, and before finally moving
            | to the obvious.
          p.text-align-j.top-paddx When it comes to entrepreneurship, it's not only about how genius the
            | idea is, but rather how well it is executed. Insightful business studies, well-thought-out business plans and effective
            | networks, all help the project evolve in influential business circles.
          p.text-align-j.top-paddx And that is how your disruption will become the next obvious. The Holy Grail.
