          p.text-align-j There is no longer any doubt that we live in a world where all aspects of the economy
            | are being reinvented by major leaps and bounds, opening up a wide spectrum of new
            | opportunities for creators, driven by the ambition to innovate and disrupt. And such is the
            | starting point for each entrepreneurial journey aiming to evolve in a context shaped
            | essentially by constant change and historical socio-economic challenges that actually
            | make our era unique.
        +section-header({info: {title:"Story of a Disruption"}})._float-left._margin-b-md.text-align-j
          p.text-align-j And with each disruptive entrepreneurial path
            | come challenges that stand in the way of ambition,
            | challenges that can sometimes shake faith and lead
            | the project to failure, regardless of its creative value
            | and potential to succeed in the market. This is
            | where a journey of a thousand frustrations can take
            | place, due to the failure of a prototype that is
            | dragging on, the inability to grasp the ins and outs
            | of the market, or the difficulty to raise funds.
        +section-header({info: {title:"Disruption is the new obvious!"}})._float-left._margin-b-md.text-align-j
          p.text-align-j We usually tend to forget that disruption is hardly embraced. Instead,
            | resistance is the natural response to changes that challenge existing
            | systems, which we can compare to that comfort zone in us extremely
            | hard to leave.
          p.text-align-j.top-paddx Most disruptive ideas are first perceived as ridiculous and bohemian
            | from a business perspective, it takes a lot of wisdom and resilience
            | before they reach the stage of serious perception, and then move on
            | to the obvious.
          p.text-align-j.top-paddx When it comes to entrepreneurship, it's not about how genius the
            | idea shows up, but rather how insightful the business study was built
            | up, the reliability of the business plan, and the effectiveness the
            | network that will help the project evolve in influential business circles.
          p.text-align-j.top-paddx These are the questions to ask if the objective is to move disruption to
            | a position were it is perceived to be obvious. The Holy Grail.
