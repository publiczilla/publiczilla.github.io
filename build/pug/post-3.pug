            | enjoy spending their friendship time in long discussions about their successes
            | and failures in business, their re-imagined idea of the entrepreneurial
            | mindset and disruptive ideas. They like to talk about how they managed to overcome the
            | difficulties that challenged their projects and managed to bring their ideas to life.
            | These friendly and intense discussions have naturally led to a common passion, for
            | which they have joined forces since 2019. They have devoted their passion to helping
            | shape the business world to become what they want. A world where innovative businesses are
            | empowered to flourish through effective business management and sustained through
            | a solid entrepreneurial network.
