          p.text-align-j PublicZilla is the story of two passionate entrepreneurs, Tarique and Nasik, who
            | enjoyed spending their friendship time on long discussions about their successes
            | and failures in business, talks in which they re-imagined the entrepreneurial
            | mindset, how to boost disruptive businesses, how they managed to overcome the
            | difficulties that challenged their projects and managed to bring their ideas to life.
            | These friendly and intense discussions have naturally led to a common passion for
            | which they joined forces since 2019, so that they devote their passion to helping
            | shape the world they aspire for, a world where innovative businesses are
            | empowered to flourish through effective business management, sustained through
            | a solid entrepreneurial network they are willing to match with innovators.
